# Educational Game Project Repo
This is the starter project repo for grade 9 students. The repo contains an Xcode template that has been setup with all the storyboards, view controllers and class files needed. This template was developed in Xcode 11.2 (11B52), and is distributed through GitHub Classroom to Grade 9 students.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local computer for development purposes. Please ensure that you are running Xcode 11.2 or later.

### Prerequisites

* Xcode 11.2 or above

### Project Configuration

This template has been configured with four individual storyboards. Each storyboard has a view controller (and view), together with a Storyboard Reference (an identifier for the storyboard), and pre-configured segues for each view controller. The reason why view controllers have been refactored to individual storyboards is to prevent merge conflicts when multiple people are working on the same storyboard.

### Usage

1. **READ** the comments within the class files for each view controller (where applicable), and understand how storyboard referencing works.
2. **DO NOT** delete **ANYTHING** from the template until you understand point 1 above.
3. Give your app a name, by going to the project settings and setting the 'Display Name' option. This change is reflected in the simulator when you build and run the app.
4. This project only has 4 storyboards (plus the LaunchScreen storyboard). You should not need more than four storyboards for your project. Remember, that code reusability is one of the key principles in software development. For example, if you are creating a quiz app with multiple questions, you only need ONE view for all the questions. If you are under the assumption that you will need a seperate view controller for each question within your app, then you are not thinking of reusability!. An easy way to think of this is if your user interface needs to look different structurally (i.e. placement of storyboard objects), then you will need to use another view.
